We are happy to announce the availability of <a href="{{site.url}}releases/spark-release-1-0-0.html" title="Spark Release 1.0.0">Spark 1.0.0</a>! Spark 1.0.0 is the first in the 1.0 line of releases, providing API stability for Spark's core interfaces. It is Spark's largest release ever, with contributions from 117 developers. 
This release expands Spark's standard libraries, introducing a new SQL package (SparkSQL) which lets users integrate SQL queries into existing Spark workflows. MLlib, Spark's machine learning library, is expanded with sparse vector support and several new algorithms. The GraphX and Streaming libraries also introduce new features and optimizations. Spark's core engine adds support for secured YARN clusters, a unified tool for submitting Spark applications, and several performance and stability improvements.
