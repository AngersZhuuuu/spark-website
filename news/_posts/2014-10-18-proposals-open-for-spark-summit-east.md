After successful events in the past two years, the <a href="http://spark-summit.org">Spark Summit</a> conference has expanded for 2015, offering both an event in New York on March 18-19 and one in San Francisco on June 15-17. The conference is a great chance to meet people from throughout the Spark community and see the latest news, tips and use cases.

Submissions are now open for <a href="http://spark-summit.org/east">Spark Summit East 2015</a>, to be held in New York on March 18th and 19th. If you'd like to give a talk on use cases, neat applications, or ongoing Spark development, <a href="http://prevalentdesignevents.com/sparksummit2015/east/speaker/">submit your talk online today</a>. Submissions will be open until December 6th, 2014.

If you missed this year's Spark Summit, you can still find videos from all talks online on the <a href="http://spark-summit.org/2014">Spark Summit 2014 website</a>.
