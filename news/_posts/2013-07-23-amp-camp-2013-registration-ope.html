Want to learn how to use Spark, Shark, GraphX, and related technologies in person? The AMP Lab is hosting a two-day training workshop for them on August 29th and 30th in Berkeley. The workshop will include tutorials, talks from users, and over four hours of hands-on exercises. <a href="http://ampcamp.berkeley.edu/amp-camp-three-berkeley-2013/">Registration is now open on the AMP Camp website</a>, for a price of $250 per person. We recommend signing up early because last year's workshop was sold out.
