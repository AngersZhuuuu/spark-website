Today we've made available two maintenance releases for Spark: <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/releases/spark-release-0-6-1.html" title="Spark Release 0.6.1">0.6.1</a> and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/releases/spark-release-0-5-2.html" title="Spark Release 0.5.2">0.5.2</a>. They both contain important bug fixes as well as some new features, such as the ability to build against Hadoop 2 distributions. We recommend that users update to the latest version for their branch; for new users, we recommend <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/releases/spark-release-0-6-1.html" title="Spark Release 0.6.1">0.6.1</a>.
