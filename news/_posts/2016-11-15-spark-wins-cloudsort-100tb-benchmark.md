We are proud to announce that Apache Spark won the <a href="http://sortbenchmark.org/">2016 CloudSort Benchmark</a> (both Daytona and Indy category). A joint team from Nanjing University, Alibaba Group, and Databricks Inc. entered the competition using NADSort, a distributed sorting program built on top of Spark, and set a new world record as the most cost-efficient way to sort 100TB of data.

They sorted 100TB of data using only $144 USD worth of public cloud resources, beating the previous record that cost $451 USD by the University of California, San Diego.

This adds to the 2014 GraySort record Spark won, and validates Spark as the most efficient data processing engine.
