The Apache Software Foundation <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/the_apache_software_foundation_announces50">announced</a> today that Spark has graduated from the Apache Incubator to become a top-level Apache project, signifying that the project's community and products have been well-governed under the ASF's meritocratic process and principles. This is a major step for the community and we are very proud to share this news with users as we complete Spark's move to Apache. Read more about Spark's growth during the past year and from contributors and users in the ASF's <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/the_apache_software_foundation_announces50">press release</a>.

As part of this change, note that Spark's <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/community.html">mailing lists</a> have moved to <tt>@spark.apache.org</tt> addresses, although the old <tt>@spark.incubator.apache.org</tt> addresses also still work.
