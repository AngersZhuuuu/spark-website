At this year's <a href="http://strataconf.com/strata2013">Strata</a> conference, the AMP Lab hosted a full day of tutorials on Spark, Shark, and Spark Streaming, including online exercises on Amazon EC2. Those exercises are now <a href="http://ampcamp.berkeley.edu/big-data-mini-course/">available online</a>, letting you learn Spark and Shark at your own pace on an EC2 cluster with real data. They are a great resource for learning the systems. You can also find <a href="http://ampcamp.berkeley.edu/amp-camp-two-strata-2013/">slides</a> from the Strata tutorials online, as well as <a href="http://ampcamp.berkeley.edu/amp-camp-one-berkeley-2012/">videos</a> from the AMP Camp workshop we held at Berkeley in August.
