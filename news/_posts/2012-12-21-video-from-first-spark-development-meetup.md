On December 18th, we held the first of a series of Spark development meetups, for people interested in learning the Spark codebase and contributing to the project. There was quite a bit more demand than we anticipated, with over 80 people signing up and 64 attending. The first meetup was an <a href="http://www.meetup.com/spark-users/events/94101942/">introduction to Spark internals</a>. Thanks to one of the attendees, there's now a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Hr5xZyTEA">video of the meetup</a> on YouTube. We've also posted the <a href="http://files.meetup.com/3138542/dev-meetup-dec-2012.pptx">slides</a>. Look to see more development meetups on Spark and Shark in the future.
