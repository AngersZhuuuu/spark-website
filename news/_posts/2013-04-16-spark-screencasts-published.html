We have released the first two screencasts in a series of short hands-on video training courses we will be publishing to help new users get up and running with Spark in minutes.

The first Spark screencast is called <a href="{{site.url}}screencasts/screencast-1-first-steps-with-spark.html">First Steps With Spark</a> and walks you through downloading and building Spark, as well as using the Spark shell, all in less than 10 minutes!

The second screencast is a 2 minute <a href="{{site.url}}screencasts/spark-documentation-overview-screencast-2.html">overview of the Spark documentation</a>.

We hope you find these screencasts useful.
