We are happy to announce the availability of <a href="{{site.url}}releases/spark-release-0-9-0.html" title="Spark Release 0.9.0">
Spark 0.9.0</a>! Spark 0.9.0 is a major release and Spark's largest release ever, with contributions from 83 developers. 
This release expands Spark's standard libraries, introducing a new graph computation package (GraphX) and adding several new features to the machine learning and stream-processing packages. It also makes major improvements to the core engine,
including external aggregations, a simplified H/A mode for long lived applications, and 
hardened YARN support.
