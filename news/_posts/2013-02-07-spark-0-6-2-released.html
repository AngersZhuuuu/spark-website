We recently released <a href="http://spark-project.org/spark-release-0-6-2/" title="Spark Release 0.6.2">Spark 0.6.2</a>, a new version of Spark. This is a maintenance release that includes several bug fixes and usability improvements (see the <a href="http://spark-project.org/spark-release-0-6-2/" title="Spark Release 0.6.2">release notes</a>). We recommend that all users upgrade to this release.
