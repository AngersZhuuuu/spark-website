We have released the next screencast, <a href="{{site.url}}screencasts/4-a-standalone-job-in-spark.html">A Standalone Job in Scala</a> that takes you beyond the Spark shell, helping you write your first standalone Spark job.

This is the fourth in a series of short hands-on video training courses to help new users get up and running with Spark in minutes.

Enjoy the news screencast!
