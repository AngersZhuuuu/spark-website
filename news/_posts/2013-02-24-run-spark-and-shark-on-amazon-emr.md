This weekend, Amazon posted an <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/articles/Elastic-MapReduce/4926593393724923">article</a> and code that make it easy to launch Spark and Shark on Elastic MapReduce. The article includes examples of how to run both interactive Scala commands and SQL queries from Shark on data in S3. Head over to the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/articles/Elastic-MapReduce/4926593393724923">Amazon article</a> for details. We're very excited because, to our knowledge, this makes Spark the first non-Hadoop engine that you can launch with EMR.
