<a href="http://www.quantifind.com">Quantifind</a>, one of the Bay Area companies that has been using Spark for predictive analytics, recently posted two useful entries on working with Spark in their tech blog:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://blog.quantifind.com/posts/spark-unit-test/">Unit testing with Spark</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.quantifind.com/posts/logging-post/">Configuring Spark's logs</a></li>
</ul>
Thanks for sharing this, and looking forward to see others!
