<h2>Reporting Security Issues</h2>

Apache Spark uses the standard process outlined by the [Apache Security Team](https://www.apache.org/security/)
for reporting vulnerabilities.

If you need to report a possible security vulnerability, please email `private@spark.apache.org`. This is a
non-public list that will reach the Spark PMC. Messages to `security@apache.org` will also reach the PMC. 

<h2>Known Security Issues</h2>
