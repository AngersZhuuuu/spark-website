Apache Spark 2.0.2 is a maintenance release containing stability fixes. We strongly recommend all 2.0.x users to upgrade to this stable release.

This release is based on the branch-2.0 maintenance branch of Spark and contains several bug fixes on top of 2.0.1. In addition, for the experimental Structured Streaming support, we have added support for Kafka 0.10 and runtime metrics.

You can consult JIRA for the [detailed changes](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12315420&version=12338301).

We would like to acknowledge all community members for contributing patches to this release.
