### Deprecations, Removals, Configs, and Behavior Changes

#### Spark Core
* DAGSchedulerâ€™s local task execution mode has been removed
* Default driver and executor memory increased from 512m to 1g
* Default setting of JVMâ€™s MaxPermSize increased from 128m to 256m
* Default logging level of spark-shell changed from INFO to WARN
* NIO-based ConnectionManager is deprecated, and will be removed in 1.6

#### Spark SQL & DataFrames
* Optimized execution using manually managed memory (Tungsten) is now enabled by default, along with code generation for expression evaluation. These features can both be disabled by setting spark.sql.tungsten.enabled to false.
* Parquet schema merging is no longer enabled by default. It can be re-enabled by setting spark.sql.parquet.mergeSchema to true.
* Resolution of strings to columns in Python now supports using dots (.) to qualify the column or access nested values. For example df['table.column.nestedField']. However, this means that if your column name contains any dots you must now escape them using backticks (e.g., ```table.`column.with.dots`.nested```).
* In-memory columnar storage partition pruning is on by default. It can be disabled by setting spark.sql.inMemoryColumnarStorage.partitionPruning to false.
* Unlimited precision decimal columns are no longer supported, instead Spark SQL enforces a maximum precision of 38. When inferring schema from BigDecimal objects, a precision of (38, 18) is now used. When no precision is specified in DDL then the default remains Decimal(10, 0).
* Timestamps are now processed at a precision of 1us, rather than 100ns.
* Sum function returns null when all input values are nulls (null before 1.4, 0 in 1.4).
* In the sql dialect, floating point numbers are now parsed as decimal. HiveQL parsing remains unchanged.
* The canonical name of SQL/DataFrame functions are now lower case (e.g. sum vs SUM).
* It has been determined that using the DirectOutputCommitter when speculation is enabled is unsafe and thus this output committer will not be used by parquet when speculation is on, independent of configuration.
* JSON data source will not automatically load new files that are created by other applications (i.e. files that are not inserted to the dataset through Spark SQL). For a JSON persistent table (i.e. the metadata of the table is stored in Hive Metastore), users can use REFRESH TABLE SQL command or HiveContext's refreshTable method to include those new files to the table. For a DataFrame representing a JSON dataset, users need to recreate the DataFrame and the new DataFrame will include new files.

#### Spark Streaming
* New experimental backpressure feature can be enabled by setting the configuration spark.streaming.backpressure.enabled to true.
* Write Ahead Log does not need to be abled for Kinesis streams. The updated Kinesis receiver keeps track of Kinesis sequence numbers received in each batch, and uses that information re-read the necessary data while recovering from failures.
* The number of times the receivers are relaunched on failure are not limited by the max Spark task attempts. The system will always try to relaunch receivers after failures until the StreamingContext is stopped.
* Improved load balancing of receivers across the executors, even after relaunching.
* Enabling checkpointing when using queueStream throws exception as queueStream cannot be checkpointed. However, we found this to break certain existing apps. So this change will be reverted in Spark 1.5.1.

#### MLlib

In the spark.mllib package, there are no breaking API changes but some behavior changes:

* [SPARK-9005](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-9005): RegressionMetrics.explainedVariance returns the average regression sum of squares.
* [SPARK-8600](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-8600): NaiveBayesModel.labels become sorted.
* [SPARK-3382](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-3382): GradientDescent has a default convergence tolerance 1e-3, and hence iterations might end earlier than 1.4.

In the experimental spark.ml package, there exists one breaking API change and one behavior change:

* [SPARK-9268](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-9268): Java's varargs support is removed from Params.setDefault due to a Scala compiler bug.
* [SPARK-10097](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-10097): Evaluator.isLargerBetter is added to indicate metric ordering. Metrics like RMSE no longer flip signs as in 1.4.


### Known Issues

The following issues are known in 1.5.0, and will be fixed in 1.5.1 release.

#### SQL/DataFrame

* [SPARK-10301](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-10301): Reading parquet files with different schema (schema merging) for nested structs can return the wrong answer
* [SPARK-10466](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-10466): AssertionError when spilling data during sort-based shuffle with data spill
* [SPARK-10441](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-10441): Timestamp data type cannot be written out as JSON
* [SPARK-10495](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-10495): Date values saved to JSON are stored as strings representing the number of days from epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC) instead of strings in the format of "yyyy-mm-dd".
* [SPARK-10403](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-10403): Tungsten mode does not work with tungsten-sort shuffle manager (which is off by default)
* [SPARK-10422](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-10422): In-memory cache of string type with dictionary encoding is broken
* [SPARK-10434](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-10434) Parquet files with null elements in arrays written by Spark 1.5.0 cannot be read by earlier versions of Spark

#### Streaming
* [SPARK-10224](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-10224) Small chance of data loss when StreamingContext is stopped gracefully
