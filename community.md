<h3>Project History</h3>


<p>
Spark started as a research project at the <a href="https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley AMPLab</a>
in 2009, and was open sourced in early 2010.
Many of the ideas behind the system are presented in various
<a href="{{site.url}}research.html">research papers</a>.
The AMPLab continues to perform research on both improving Spark and on systems built on top, such as
<a href="{{site.shark_url}}">Shark</a>, <a href="{{site.graphx_url}}">GraphX</a>, and
<a href="{{site.url}}streaming/">Spark Streaming</a>.
</p>

<p>
After being released, Spark grew a developer community on GitHub and entered Apache in 2013
as its permanent home.
A wide range of contributors now develop the project (over 120 developers from 25 companies).
